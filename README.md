## Building

Right now I'm using [`zola`](https://getzola.org) to build this website. Once you have it you have it ...

```
# This will build the website for static deployment
$ zola build
```

```
# This will create a local static webserver; it's useful for testing formatting / readability
$ zola serve
```

In general check out [the docs for `zola`](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/cli-usage/)
